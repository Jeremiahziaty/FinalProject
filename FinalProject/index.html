<h1>Game Rules</h1>
</p>

<h2>The Objective:</h2>
<p>The objective of the game is for the player to hold a set of cards that add up to 21 or get as close as they can without exceeding 21. <br> The only way to win is to have a better hand than the dealer.
</p>
<h2>Place the Bet:</h2>
<p>Before the dealing of cards starts, the player will be asked how much he would like to bet. <br>The bet can range from two dollars up to five hundred dollars.
</p>
<h2>The Deal:</h2>
<p>Two cards will be dealt to the player. A choice of “stand” or “hit me” is available after the deal.</p>
</body>
<h2>Gain and Loss of Money:</h2>
<p>
    If a blackjack is obtained by the player and the dealer does not have one, the dealer <br> immediately pays the player one and a half of the amount of the bet.<br>
    If both dealer and player have blackjack, the game ends in a tie and the player keeps what he betted.<br>
    If either the player or dealer exceed 21 at any time, the game results in a bust for the individual.
