<hr size="2">
<p>Hello my name is Jeremiah Ziaty. I am a transfer student from Des Moines,IA here to play soccer.
    <br>I'm majoring in Information System and one day hope to work as an It Consultant. I've always been intrigued by computers and how they work.
    I've never had a job that pertains to working specifically with computers but I hope to get one this summer so I can get my feet wet<br>
